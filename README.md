## üéØ How to Use This Guide

1. **Choose a project** based on your current skill level
2. **Read the requirements** and system design considerations
3. **Implement the code** yourself (don't copy-paste!)
4. **Test thoroughly** and optimize performance
5. **Document your learnings** and challenges

## üî• Ready to Start?

Pick your first project and begin implementing! Each project builds upon the previous ones, so it's recommended to follow the order.

**Remember**: The goal is to learn by doing, not by copying code. Implement each feature yourself to truly understand the concepts.
